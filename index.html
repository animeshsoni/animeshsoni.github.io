            <h1>Experience</h1>
   		      <h3>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h3>


   		  	<p>I have been an undergraduate teaching assistant since August 2017 for the department of computer science and engineering at UB.
          I am currently a teaching assistant for a freshmen seminar on how the internet works which explores different aspects
          of the Internet like Data Compression, Embedded Systems, Web Design, Infrastructure, Security and Social Media. My role
          as a teaching assistant is to conduct weekly hands-on activities for over 25 students and to lead discussions, recitations
          and evaluate assignments. It also involves working as a team with co TAs and professors to ensure smooth progression of the seminar.
          I was also a teaching assistant for intro to programming in the spring of 2018. This class was an introduction to programming for non majors
          using Processing, which is an object oriented open-source graphical library. My role as a teaching assistant was to teach major concepts
          of programming in 2 two hour labs with atleast 30 students each week, lead class discussions, answer questions, record student progress,
          evaluate projects, labs, exams and other assessments for over 100 students.</p>
