      			<h1>About Me</h1>

      			<p class="lead">My name is Animesh Soni and I am a full-time student at University at Buffalo. I expect to graduate in May 2020 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
            I am an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the Department of CSE at UB and also a Resident Advisor for the Campus Living at UB.</p>

            <h1>Experience</h1>
   		      <h3>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h3>


   		  	<p>I have been an undergraduate teaching assistant since August 2017 for the department of computer science and engineering at UB.
          I am currently a teaching assistant for a freshmen seminar on how the internet works which explores different aspects
          of the Internet like Data Compression, Embedded Systems, Web Design, Infrastructure, Security and Social Media. My role
          as a teaching assistant is to conduct weekly hands-on activities for over 25 students and to lead discussions, recitations
          and evaluate assignments. It also involves working as a team with co TAs and professors to ensure smooth progression of the seminar.
          I was also a teaching assistant for intro to programming in the spring of 2018. This class was an introduction to programming for non majors
          using Processing, which is an object oriented open-source graphical library. My role as a teaching assistant was to teach major concepts
          of programming in 2 two hour labs with atleast 30 students each week, lead class discussions, answer questions, record student progress,
          evaluate projects, labs, exams and other assessments for over 100 students.</p>

               <h3>Resident Advisor</h3>

   	         <p>I have been a resident advisor since August 2018 for the campus living at UB. My role as an RA is to serve as a role model to about
               800 students, play an active and positive role in a studentâ€™s engagement with campus life, schedule and hold individual meetings
               throughout the year with all residents to provide individual support and attention, resolve conflicts and host monthly programs to
               build a strong community in the residence hall. This job requires working with a team of 18 co-RAs and two hall directors, effective
               communication and strong leadership qualities. All the residents advisors of campus living have to go through day of group and personal
               interviews to get hired and two weeks of rigorous training before starting.
   		  		</p>

   		      <h3>Student Assistant</h3>
   		      <p>I have been a student assistant since January 2018 for the Honors College at UB. My role as a student assistant is to perform
               administrative tasks, manage student files, maintain the office space, support the advisors through time sensitive tasks related
               to organization and communication.

                  <h1>Projects</h1>
         		      <h3>Interpreter</h3>
         		  	<p>I used python for this project. I constructed an interpreter, which could analyze and execute a program line by line. It could
                  read in different data types including int, double, float, string, boolean and char and perform logical and mathematical operations
                  like comparison, addition, multiplication, concatenation etcetra on those data types. It could also read and perform functions
                  with various arguments. It used various levels of scopes using let and end, which created multiple stacks of working environment.
                  I then did the same project in SML to have a better understanding of functional programming.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Crowd Tracker Heat Map</h3>
         	         <p>I worked in a team of 3 on this project for Dandy Hacks hackathon at the University of Rochester. This project was insprired
                     by the problem of having to wait in long lines for food at the food joints on campus. We used HTML, CSS, Javascript and Google Maps
                     API for this project to make a web application which could track the number of people at a particular location and then produce
                     a heat map for the crowd density. This app would provide the information on the number of people in a food court and help you
                     make a decision on whether or not to eat there based on your schedule. My role in the team was to work on the HTML and to help with
                     debugging. I was also in charge of testing it on various platforms, handle the traffic and making sure it had no issues.

         		      <h3>HTML Validator</h3>
         		      <p>I used C++ for this project. I created a HTML validator which could read in an HTML file as text, convert it into a DOM tree and
                    then check if it contained all the necessary starting and enging tags in correct order with the required content inside them needs to display as an HTML page.
                    It also checked the file for other possible syntax errors.
         		  		</p>

                  <h3>Step Counting Application</h3>
         		      <p>I worked on this project for UB Hacking at the University at Buffalo. It was a foundation for a step counter made in the Android Studio
                    using Java for android devices. The goal of this project was to get me accustomed to working with the Android Studio.
         		  		</p>

                  <h3>Fractal Generator</h3>
         		      <p>I created a Java application that generated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal" target="blank"><font color="gray"><u>fractals</u></font></a> by taking various inputs from the user. It was a GUI heavy project and
                     I used the Java swing library for all the graphics. It consisted of menus, drop downs, pop ups and other various interactive components.
                     It used the inputs from the user to create a 2d array of pixel objects and then use the information in each object to produce the fractals.
                    I also used multi-threading for higher resolution fractals and for multiple fractals which improved the performance by 15%.
         		  		</p>

                  <h3>Puzzle Game</h3>
                  <p>I made a puzzle video game using Java. The objective of this game was to match three tiles in a row or column. It worked similar to candy crush.
                    It had 5 progressive levels, kept the score and used it to advance the user to the next level. I used the Java swing library for the GUI.
